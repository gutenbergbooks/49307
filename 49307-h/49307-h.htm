<h2>To the Prospective Student</h2>


<p>If you are about to make your start in life, or not satisfied with
your present line of work, or for the sake of your health are desirous
of securing a change of employment which will take you out into the
open air, it is worth your while to consider the matter of learning to
be an expert automobile operator and to take up that line of work.</p>

<p>The great growth and development of the automobile and its use
needs no comment. The compensation of the chauffeur is good and
the demand for his services so steady, and the standing of the profession
is so high now, that it is more and more attractive to that class of
individuals who are able and willing to combine mechanical skill with
intellectual effort.</p>

<p>It is for that class of men this course is intended and it is that class
of men, who, by supplementing their natural mechanical genius with a
little properly directed mental work, can qualify themselves to secure
well paid positions, such as, to the proper persons, are certain to prove
stepping stones to greater advancement.</p>

<p>The great number of chauffeurs who enjoy the esteem and confidence
of their wealthy employers is well known, and we could enumerate
hundreds who have started in business for themselves and who
are on the road to wealth through the assistance of their employer.</p>

<h2>The Object of Our School</h2>


<p>The object of our School is to prepare young men throughout the
country to become expert chauffeurs, repairmen, demonstrators, salesmen,
garage managers, etc.</p>

<p>Our president, Mr. C. A. Coey, has been in the automobile business
for twelve years, and he is one of the most prominent automobile men
in America today.</p>

<p>During this time he has sold thousands of automobiles, and his
customers can be found in every state in the Union. He found that
the only way he could supply the demands of the automobile dealers
and manufacturers throughout the country, was to open a school of
motoring, and it is for this reason that <em>C. A. COEY'S SCHOOL OF
MOTORING</em> was started.</p>

<p>Mr. Coey commenced as a small farmer boy himself, and he
knows that the country boys are even more ambitious than those in
the city, but they do not have the opportunities like the city boys. And
because he knew that there were plenty of such young men all over the
country, who would be able to fill just such positions, if they could but
prepare themselves, and at the same time to supply the demand from
his customers throughout the country for good honest young men he
founded this School.</p>

<h2>A Word About our President<br />
Mr. C. A. Coey</h2>


<p>Mr. Coey has been prominently identified with the automobile
business in Chicago from its inception, in fact, he is the pioneer automobile
man of Chicago.</p>

<p>He constructed the first building ever erected in America for an
automobile garage, which is now standing at the corner of Cottage
Grove Avenue and 53rd St., Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>He placed the first taxicabs on the streets of Chicago and now
owns the best in the city.</p>

<div class="caption">The first taxicab seen in Chicago&mdash;C.

</div>
</div>


<p>He is one of the few who made a success of the automobile livery
business, beginning with one car and increasing to fifty. Commencing
with practically nothing, he built up not only the largest automobile
livery business in the country, but also the largest automobile sales
business in America. The companies bearing his name now maintain
a large garage and salesroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Coey is intimately connected with some of the foremost men of
this country and is well known as an automobile manufacturer and
dealer throughout the country, and a <em>DIPLOMA</em> with his name signed
to it is the best thing you can have when looking for any kind of employment
in the automobile industry.</p>

<p>He has secured more good paying positions for his students and
friends than all other auto schools in America combined, because he is
so well known.</p>

six hundred and seven miles in ten hours
and fifty-five minutes, ascending at Quincy, Illinois,
on the 2nd day of June, 1907, in the evening
and sailing through the clouds all night, through
thunder storms, and making a landing at Clear

<h2>Our Correspondence Course</h2>


<p>For the benefit of those who cannot spare the time to come to
our School, we have compiled a correspondence course, in which we
will guarantee to teach you how to run, repair and demonstrate any
automobile <em>in ten weeks</em>.</p>

<p>This course consists of ten lessons all written plainly and in such
an intelligent manner, that anyone who can read and write can master
any automobile.</p>

<p>They lead you step by step, on and on until you have reached the
end, and then you will be surprised at your own knowledge of an automobile.</p>

<p>We send you one lesson at a time, and as soon as you have answered
all of the questions contained on the last page of the book correctly,
we will send you the next lesson, and so on, until you have
received the ten lessons. Some can master two and three a week&mdash;it
all depends upon the person.</p>

<p>We assist backward students by giving more time to them and
answering any questions they wish to ask, as we desire above everything
else to make every student a first class high grade automobile man, an
honor to our School and a help to us and our customers.</p>

<p>The cost of our correspondence course is $15.00. If, after you have
finished our correspondence course, you wish to learn the manufacture
of a motor car, you can come to our factory, and we will give you our
practical course at our regular rates and deduct the amount you have
paid for the correspondence course.</p>

<p>Many who have decided to come to our factory and take our practical
course wait until they have finished the correspondence course,
where in the quiet of their homes they can get the principles fixed in
their minds, and then when they come to our School they are ready for
business.</p>

<h2>Ten Weeks Sufficient</h2>


<p>There is no reason why one cannot finish our course in the allotted
time of ten weeks, but no charge will be made if more time is required,
as we desire above everything to give you such a course that your
efficiency will make your work a pleasure.</p>

<p>Your work can be done as well thousands of miles away as if you
were on the ground at our School.</p>

<p>If you contemplate purchasing a machine, you could not do better
than to first take our course, when you will be able to judge better
on your own account precisely what style of machine is peculiarly
adapted to your needs and your particular section of the country.</p>

<p>We can be of great service to you in choosing a machine. Some
machines are better adapted to certain localities than others; for instance,
a hilly or sandy country requires a low geared, light weight,
high powered machine, and you can rest assured on getting our unbiased
opinion.</p>

<p>Our course has been taken by many ladies who own or contemplate
owning a machine, and they are among those who are most emphatic
in praising our method of teaching.</p>

<h2>Remember</h2>

<p>It is a nice thing to understand a motor, whether you ever intend
to drive one or not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>No one should purchase an automobile without first taking our
course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>The man who buys a motor car without first learning one will live
to regret the day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>Astonishing, but nevertheless true, not one-half of the machines
manufactured are fit to be placed on the market. Do you know the
reason why?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>Never buy a car with the weak point, every other car has it, take
our course and be able to select the right one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>Motoring is easy and pleasant, if you are its master, but if you
are not, you had better stay at home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>Whether you spend most of your time under the car or on the car,
depends on whether or not you understand it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>A thousand things can happen to a motor, any one of which is
easily remedied if you know where to begin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 80px;">
<img src="images/page_18.jpg" width="80" height="24" alt="ornament" />
</div>

<p>A Diploma is valuable when backed by one who is prominent in the
automobile world, and with a <em>COEY DIPLOMA</em> at your back, you are
independent for life.</p>

<h2>Our Practical Course</h2>


<p>There is, perhaps, no place in this wide world where the student
can get such thorough training as at our factory. We are the only ones
in this country who have a factory where up-to-date automobiles are
actually built by students.</p>

<div class="figleftf" style="max-width: 300px;">
<img src="images/page_19a.jpg" width="300" height="209" alt="" />

<div class="caption">Each student works alone&mdash;showing
the separate apartments.</div>
</div>

<div class="cr"></div>

<p>The average practical automobile school, and we might say every
last one of them, instruct their students on old, worn-out, out-of-date
machines, which are ready for the junk pile, and what they learn on
those old relics will do them no good, in fact, they might better have
taken no schooling at all, as such work only tends to confuse and mislead
them. For if a person once learns to do a thing the wrong way,
he usually keeps on doing it and it is hard to get out of the habit.
And that is the reason why our students have been successful in filling
fine, easy, and well paying positions, because they are instructed on
up-to-date machines in an up-to-date manner.</p>

<div class="figleftf" style="max-width: 300px;">

</div>

<div class="cr"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>In our factory we teach a student the art of automobile building,
and teach him to drive the machine he himself has helped to build.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="images/page_20a.jpg" width="400" height="162" alt="" />

<p>He takes it from the ground up, under the very best trained and

he can command big wages.</p>

<div class="caption">One of our cars which students are instructed to operate.</div>
</div>

<p>It requires from three to eight weeks to go through our factory, all
depending on the aptness of the student. We try to get our students
through as quickly as possible, but we will not issue a Diploma until
in our estimation he is qualified to fill any position in connection with
an automobile.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Since you have decided to take up the automobile business, the
question naturally arises, "Where can I learn it the best? and after I
have learned it, which school is in better shape to help me to get a good
paying position?"</p>

<p>Any school will tell you they will assist you, but what does that
mean? It means simply nothing at all because there is nothing behind
it. Assistance will do you no good unless you get the position.</p>

<p>The President of the United States could give you any kind of a
position you could ask for, because he has the influence, so could the
Governor of your state&mdash;influence is what counts. You stand a far
better chance of getting a good paying position through our School&mdash;yes,
ten to one, better than in any other school in the world.</p>

<p>Anyone with ordinary intelligence can write a book on automobile
instruction&mdash;anyone can run an advertisement in the paper and get
replies, and send out glowing literature, and get letters from prominent
automobile men and dealers and manufacturers, but when it comes to
getting you a position that is where they are weak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>We could name one auto school owner in the middle West and one
in the East, who were never in the automobile business, and who do
not even now own one. They send out glowing advertisements and
secure letters from auto manufacturers and dealers to help them get
started, but if you can find where a single person has ever secured a
position through these letters or through their influence, excepting a few
whom they have paid themselves in order to get some recommendations,
we will send you our course free.</p>

<p>Do you know that Mr. Coey is the only one of any importance in the
automobile world whatsoever who is connected with an automobile
school? Do you know that he is the only one who is engaged in handling
high grade motor cars? And last but not least, not another person in the
world running an automobile school has any connection with an automobile
factory. So what does it mean?</p>

<p>Just this&mdash;that instead of a few ex-chauffeurs or ex-clerks banding
together and calling themselves an auto school, we have as our head
a <em>real automobile man</em>, one with vast interests and prominently connected
in many branches of the business, and one who can secure you
a position.</p>

<h2>Our Diploma</h2>


<p>There is no better recommendation for anyone than a Diploma
from <em>C. A. COEY'S SCHOOL OF MOTORING</em>, which stands the country
over for <em>SUCCESS</em>.</p>

<p>It is one thing to learn the automobile business, but quite another
to get profitable employment. Forty diplomas will not help you unless
the School is backed by someone well-known in the automobile world.</p>

<p>It is not our policy to get your money and then rush you through.
We are interested in you from the time you start until long after you
have finished. We cannot conduct our business throughout the country
without <em>you</em>, so <em>we must train you right</em>.</p>

<p>The thousands of automobiles which Mr. Coey sold during the past
ten years all need drivers, and our customers and agents in every territory
look to us to keep them supplied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="images/page_23.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="" />
<div class="caption">This is the thing that will insure you a job at any time and at any place.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2>Employment Department</h2>


<p>This department is maintained for the exclusive use of our students
<em>free of charge</em>. We supply first class help for positions as:</p>

<p class="center bm">Chauffeurs,</p>

<p class="center bm">Racers,</p>

<p class="center bm">Auto Salesmen,</p>

<p class="center bm">Demonstrators,</p>

<p class="center bm">Garage Managers,</p>

<p class="center bm">Assemblers for factories,</p>

<h2>Terms of Tuition</h2>

<p>While our course is the most complete and thorough, yet our rates
have been kept as low as possible. As we figure we might better have
students in all walks of life, we have placed the price within reach of
all. It is, however, subject to a raise without notice.</p>

<h2>City Examinations</h2>


<p>After you have spent your time in an Auto School then comes the
city examination, which, if you do not pass, you might as well not have
wasted your time. Do you know that over one-half who, after they
have secured their diploma, are not able to pass the examinations for
a City License? Well, it is true. <em>But not a single one of OUR students
has ever failed to pass the examinations and secure a chauffeur's
license.</em></p>

<p>The City Mechanician of Chicago, Mr. H. L. Hudson, who decides
whether or not you are entitled to a license, commenced with Mr. Coey
in the automobile business in 1900. He was Mr. Coey's private mechanician
on his racing cars. Mr. Hudson is an automobile expert and that
is the reason he holds a fine city position. He recently inspected our
School, and this is what he said:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p>"I wish to compliment you on the method you employ in your School of Motoring.
The many years I spent as mechanician on your private racing cars certainly furnished
us both information of a definite character, which is necessary for a man holding such
an important position as Automobile School Instructor and Examiner of the Board of
Public Motor Vehicle Register of the City of Chicago.</p>

<p>You seem to have the proper system and your vast experience with chauffeurs
in the ten years past fits you, as no one else is fitted, for a competent instructor. I
believe you are on the right track and wish you success.</p>

<p class="right2">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="right">(Signed) H. L. HUDSON,</p>
<p class="right">City Mechanician."</p>

</div>

<p>The following is what the Chicago Examiner has to say about our
School. (This article appeared without our knowledge and shows
our standing in the City of Chicago, which assures you of a square
deal.)</p>


<div class="bq">

<p class="center bm">"SCHOOL IS OPENED TO INSTRUCT AUTO DRIVERS."</p>

<p>"A motoring school for the purpose of instructing persons in the running of automobiles
has just been opened by C. A. Coey. This school will be of national scope
and owing to the fact that Chicago is centrally located and the great railroad and mail
distributing center, it will enable persons desirous of availing themselves of the benefits
of institutions of this sort, to be in direct communication with instructors. Mr. Coey
is nationally recognized as one of America's pioneer motorists and he realizes, as do
the manufacturers, that the failure of so many automobiles to perform their proper
functions and the occurrence of so great a number of accidents are due to the inefficiency
of persons handling them."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>A clipping from the Chicago Journal reads as follows:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p>"Charles A. Coey is one of the pioneer automobile men of Chicago. He entered
the business in 1900 and conducted a motor livery until 1902, when he became Chicago
agent for the Thomas Flyer. He handled the Thomas line from 1902 until 1909, when
he gave up the selling end to devote all his attention to his taxicab business. Last
year he became Chicago agent for the American car, which he is handling under a
ten-year contract. He is president of a company which is manufacturing the Coey
Flyer in Chicago. Mr. Coey is well-known as an automobile racing driver and aeronaut.
He won the Chicago Automobile Club's twenty-four-hour race at Harlem several years
ago. He has made many long-distance flights in balloons."</p>
</div>

<p>And the Live Stock Magazine has this to say:</p>

<div class="bq">

<p>"Perhaps the oldest and most prominent person in the automobile business in
Chicago is C. A. Coey, the pioneer automobile dealer. Mr. Coey started an automobile
school in 1901 at 5311 Cottage Grove Ave., Chicago, and it was there that the first
building ever erected for an Automobile Livery was built. While Mr. Coey did not at
that time advertise his School of Motoring, yet he started on an extensive business in
this line, and it was said that over one thousand are now holding good, steady, well-paying
jobs, and drawing salaries up to $75 a week. Mr. Coey's system is different
from the rest, as he believes that a student can learn the foundation principles in
the quiet of his home, and then after he has mastered the principles he is given a
practical road course. We recommend this School as a reliable institution."</p>

<h2>How to get an Automobile Absolutely Free</h2>


<p>As we told you in another part of this book&mdash;<em>WE ARE BUILDING
AUTOMOBILES</em>&mdash;a machine of the highest quality and the very latest
design, the specifications of which can be found on the last page of
this book.</p>


<h3><i>AGENTS WANTED</i></h3>

<p>We desire agents in every county in the United States and to those
who take our course, either the correspondence or the practical course,
we make this offer:</p>

<p>First, as soon as you have commenced to take our course we give
you the right to sell the <em>COEY FLYER</em>, and for every one you sell, we
will send you $200.00 in gold, and then after you have sold ten machines,
we will send you one <em>ABSOLUTELY FREE</em>, and prepay the freight on
same to any part of the United States, so that it is delivered to you free
from all cost.</p>

<p>We will extend this offer to no one who has not taken a course in our
School of Motoring, for we know that after you have taken this course,
you are capable of operating <em>ANY MACHINE</em> without any trouble, and
it will be an advertisement for our School as well as for our machine.</p>


<h3><i>EVERY STUDENT MADE AN AGENT</i></h3>

<p>Second, as soon as you have commenced to take our course, we
will send you a quantity of circulars and a large poster which you can
hang in some conspicuous place, with your name in bold type at the
bottom, showing you as our agent.</p>


<h3><i>NOW GET BUSY!</i></h3>

<p>The Automobile business has come to stay and there will be many
machines sold in the next few months to people that you already know,
and if you let them know that you are our agent, they will be glad
to buy from you, as they will readily see that you can be of great help
to them when they commence to learn to run their machine, and they
can buy from you as cheaply as if they had come to Chicago and bought
direct from us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>We would suggest that in order to get a Coey Flyer in your locality
at once, that you go to someone whom you know is going to buy a
machine and tell him that if he will allow you to use his automobile
occasionally you will give him your commission, and if he knows that
he can save $200, he will be glad to do it.</p>

<p>This is the grandest offer ever made by anyone, and those who take
advantage of it will thank us a thousand times. Just think&mdash;a chance
to get rich for only $15.00. Have you ever had such an offer?</p>
